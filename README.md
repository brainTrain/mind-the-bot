# Minecraft Botz
_This bot remote controls a normal minecraft account, if you want to play with your bot the easiest way is to just pay for a new mojang account for your bot._

_This bot is built using [mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer)_

## Basic starting instructions

`npm install`

`npm start`

## Setting up environment

Start by copying the `.env-template` file to a `.env` file

```console
$ cp .env-template .env
```

Set values for the environment variables

| Name | Description | Type |
|------| ------------|------|
| `MC_HOST_IP` | IP of the MC server you want to join. | IPV6 |
| `MC_USERNAME` | Username of the bot's mojang or microsoft account. | String |
| `MC_PASSWORD` | Password for the bot's mojang or microsoft account. | String |
| `MC_AUTH_TYPE` | Type to tell [mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) which auth to use.  | `mojang` \| `microsoft`|
| `ACTION_PHRASE` | Word or phrase that the bot should choose as a delimiter. The bot will parse the rest of that chat message as a command and respond appropriately. | String |

## Commands
_You can trigger a command by adding the `ACTION_PHRASE` to your minecraft chat message. Any text typed after your `ACTION_PHRASE` in the same minecraft chat message will be parsed as a command, and a substring match is used to trigger the proper response. The Command listed in these tables are just the substring match, if you add extra words to be more conversational you'll still trigger the proper response._
